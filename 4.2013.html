   <p >The final of the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy was played on 23 June 2013 between the England and India at the Edgbaston Cricket Ground, Birmingham.This was the 7th ICC Champions Trophy. India won the match by 5 runs. England qualified into the final by defeating South Africa in the first semi-final at The Oval, London on 19 June 2013. India made their way into the final after defeating Sri Lanka in the second semi-final played at SWALEC Stadium, Cardiff on 20 June 2013. The match was delayed almost six hours due to rain and started at 16:20 local time, and the match was reduced to 20 overs per innings. So all the rules of this match were the same as a Twenty20 game.It was India's 2nd ICC Champions Trophy championship after the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy. But they had to share the honour with Sri Lanka since this was a joint championship winning. So this was the first time when India won that title individually. In addition India became the second team after Australia to win the ICC Champions Trophy more than one time.Ravindra Jadeja earned the man of the match award for scoring 33 runs and taking 2 wickets in the match. Shikhar Dhawan was named the man of the series for scoring 363 runs in the tournament.
