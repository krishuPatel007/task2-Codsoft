        Dhoni was acquired by Chennai Super Kings (CSK) for US$1.5 million during the auction for the inaugural season of the Indian Premier League (IPL). He was the most expensive signing in the auction. Dhoni scored 414 runs to lead CSK to the finals in the first season of IPL. Under his captaincy, CSK won the 2010 edition and qualified for Champions League Twenty20. Chennai won the 2010 Champions league. Dhoni scored 392 runs and led CSK to its second consecutive IPL title in 2011. Dhoni led CSK to its second Champions League Twenty20 title in 2014.[129] Dhoni scored 2987 runs from 129 matches in the IPL across the first eight seasons for the Super Kings.

Following the two-year suspension of Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals, two new franchises Rising Pune Supergiants and Gujarat Lions were established for the 2016 Indian Premier League season. Supergiants picked Dhoni as one of their five draft picks on 15 December 2015 for ₹125 million (US$1.5 million). He scored 574 runs in 30 matches across two seasons for the Supergiants.

Dhoni returned to CSK for the 2018 season. He scored 455 runs and led his team to its third IPL title. Dhoni led CSK to the title again in 2021 and was retained for ₹12 crore (US$1.4 million) before the auction for the 2022 season. Dhoni stepped down from captaincy ahead of that season and Ravindra Jadeja was appointed the new captain. However, a month later, Jadeja handed over the captaincy back to Dhoni in the middle of the season. Dhoni led the franchise to victory again the following season. Under his captaincy, CSK became the most successful IPL franchise with five title wins and ten final appearances. Dhoni became the first player to play 200 T20 matches for CSK and holds the record for most appearances in the IPL. Ahead of the 2024 season, Dhoni handed over captaincy to Ruturaj Gaikwad. He marked his 250th appearance for CSK in this season, in a league stage match against Mumbai Indians on 14 April 2024, helping his team secure a 20-run win, following his unbeaten four-ball 20.
