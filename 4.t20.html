        Dhoni made his T20 international debut in December 2006 against South Africa at Johannesburg. Dhoni was subsequently named in the ODI team of the year by the ICC for 2006. MS Dhoni has played 98 matches to date in his T20 career and has scored 1,617 runs, with an average of 38. MS Dhoni has hit 116 fours and 52 sixes in his T20 career.In his most recent T20 match against Australia at M.Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bangalore, India, which took place in Feb 2019, MS Dhoni contributed 40 runs off 23 balls to his team's total.
        Dhoni was not selected for the T20I squad for the series that followed and the Australia tour later that season. However, he was included in the squad for the ODI series in Australia. In the three-match series, Dhoni scored half-centuries in all three games with the latter two resulting in wins, helping India secure a 2â€“1 series victory, their first in a bilateral series on Australian soil and was named player of the series while also becoming the fourth Indian to score more than 1,000 ODI runs in Australia.
